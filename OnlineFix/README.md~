# WannaSmile

WannaCry Ransomware is spreading like wild fire. It uses vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB ( which is turned on by default ).

On 13th may 2017 , security researcher going with the handle @malwaretech and Darien Huss found a 'kill-switch' which paused the ransomware. Basically the ransomware opens a unregistered domain and if fail to open then the system is infected. So @malwaretech registered the domain which stopped the ransomware.

Soon Cyber criminals around the world DDOSed it to take it down so that the ransomeware can continue affecting. 

**Also the 'kill-switch' won't work if :**
-  system is not connected to internet
-  if the 'kill-switch' domain is down
-  if it is blocked by the isp or firewall

## The solution

**WannaSmile** is a simple program which can solve the problem

It can do the following :

-  It will disable SMB in your system ( which is enabled by default )
-  It will edit your host file and add google's IP to the **'kill-switch'** ( which means even if the site goes down you wont be affected )

## How to run

You directly run the .exe file and it will do the magic. ( Run as Administrator ). If you don't trust our .exe file then you yourself can compile and run it.

**Also we are coming up with the version 2.0 of it which will create a local server and change the host files to local server so that even if your system is offline , the ransomeware won't be able to affect you.**
